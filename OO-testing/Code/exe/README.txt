To run MCM:
1. Open terminal/cmd and go into the folder containing Server.jar
2. Use command "java -jar Server.jar inputFilePath" to start the Server. Please replace "inputFilePath" with an input file provided in exe.zip. The Server process is shown as javaw at the process list of Windows Task Manager.
3. Open a new terminal, use command "java -jar Client.jar" to start the client.
4. While exploring the client, if you meet any stuck point, please first check if there is any error message printed in terminal. For example, you need to terminate an active Server process before you start another Server process.
